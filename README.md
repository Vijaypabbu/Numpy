# NumPy 
NumPy(Numerical Python) is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.
1. Introduction to NumPy
 1.1 WHAT IS NUMPY?
  NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source Python library that provides powerful tools for performing numerical computations and working with multi-dimensional arrays. It serves as the foundation for many other scientific computing libraries in Python 
  and is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific research.
 1.2 WHY USE NUMPY IN DATA SCIENCE?
   NumPy offers several advantages for data science tasks:
     # Efficient array operations:
       NumPy provides fast and efficient implementations of mathematical operations on arrays, making it suitable for large-scale data processing.
     # Multi-dimensional arrays:
       NumPy arrays allow for efficient storage and manipulation of multi-dimensional data, such as matrices or tensors.
     # Broadcasting:
       NumPy supports broadcasting, which enables operations between arrays of different shapes, making code concise and readable.
     # Integration with other libraries:
       NumPy seamlessly integrates with other data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and sci-kit-learn, providing a comprehensive ecosystem for data analysis and machine learning.
     
2. Installing and Importing NumPy:
 2.1 Installation Instructions:
   To install NumPy, you can use the Python package manager, pip. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:
     ** pip install numpy **
   This will download and install the latest version of NumPy.
 2.2Importing NumPy:
   Once NumPy is installed, you can import it into your Python script or Jupyter Notebook using the following import statement:
      ** import numpy as np **
   The "np" alias is commonly used for NumPy to shorten the code.

3. NumPy Arrays:
  3.1 Creating NumPy Arrays:
    NumPy arrays are the fundamental data structure in NumPy. They can be created in several ways:
    1. Using the numpy.array() function:
        This function takes a sequence-like object (e.g., list, tuple) and creates a NumPy array from it.
    2. Using the numpy.arange() function:
        This function creates an array with regularly spaced values within a specified range.
    3. Using the numpy.zeros() and numpy.ones() functions:
        These functions create arrays filled with zeros or ones, respectively.
  3.2 Array Attributes:
      NumPy arrays have various attributes that provide useful information about the array's shape, size, and data type. Some commonly used attributes include:
        shape: Returns a tuple representing the size of each dimension of the array.
        dtype: Returns the data type of the array elements.
        ndim: Returns the number of array dimensions.
        size: Returns the total number of elements in the array.
        itemsize: Returns the size in bytes of each array element.
  3.3 Indexing and Slicing Arrays:
        NumPy arrays can be accessed and sliced using indexing and slicing operations. The indexing starts at 0, and negative indices can be used to access elements from the end of the array.
  3.4 ArrayOperations
        NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical and logical operations on arrays. These operations are applied elementwise, and they can be performed between arrays of compatible shapes.
  3.5 Broadcasting:
        Broadcasting is a powerful feature of NumPy that allows arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes. It eliminates the need for explicit looping and simplifies the code.
       
4. Array Manipulation:
  4.1 Reshaping Arrays:   
        NumPy provides several methods to reshape arrays, including reshape(), flatten(), and ravel(). Reshaping allows you to change the dimensions of an array without changing the underlying data.
  4.2 Joining and Splitting Arrays:
        NumPy allows you to concatenate or stack arrays together using functions like concatenate(), vstack(), and hstack(). Similarly, you can split arrays into multiple smaller arrays using split(), vsplit(), and hsplit().
  4.3 Changing Array Data Types:
        NumPy provides functions to change the data type of an array, such as astype(). This is particularly useful when you need to convert an array to a different data type for computation or storage.
  4.4 Sorting and Searching Arrays:
        NumPy offers functions for sorting arrays, such as sort() and argsort(). You can also search for elements using functions like where() and searchsorted().
   
5. Mathematical Functions:
  5.1 Basic Mathematical Operations:
        NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions for performing basic operations on arrays. These functions include add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide(),and more.
  5.2 Trigonometric Functions:
        NumPy provides various trigonometric functions, such as sin(), cos(), tan(), arcsin(), arccos(), and arctan(). These functions operate element-wise on arrays.
  5.3 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:
        NumPy provides various trigonometric functions, such as sin(), cos(), tan(), arcsin(), arccos(), and arctan(). These functions operate element-wise on arrays.
  5.4 Statistical Functions:
        NumPy offers a variety of statistical functions for analyzing arrays, such as mean(), median(), std(), var(), min(), and max().
  5.5 Linear Algebra Operations:
        NumPy provides linear algebra functions for matrix operations, such as dot(), transpose(), inverse(), and eig().

6. Array Input and Output:
  6.1 Saving and Loading Arrays:
       NumPy provides functions to save and load arrays from disk. You can use np.save() to save an array to a binary file and np.load() to load the array back into memory.
  6.2 Text File Input and Output:
       NumPy allows you to save and load arrays in text file format using np.savetxt() and np.loadtxt(). This is useful for sharing data with other applications or for human-readable storage.
  6.3 Binary File Input and Output:
       NumPy supports saving and loading arrays in binary format using np.save() and np.load(). Binary files are more spaceefficient and faster to read and write compared to text files.
  6.4 Compressed File Input and Output:
        NumPy allows you to save and load compressed arrays using np.savez() and np.load() with the .npz file extension. This is useful for saving memory and reducing storage space.

7. Advanced NumPy Features:   
  7.1 Broadcasting in Depth:
        Broadcasting is a powerful feature of NumPy that allows arrays of different shapes to be combined in arithmetic operations. NumPy automatically applies broadcasting rules to make the arrays compatible for the operation.
  7.2 Array Manipulation Tricks:
        NumPy provides various tricks for manipulating arrays efficiently, such as swapping axes, repeating elements, and stacking arrays.
  7.3 Fancy Indexing and Boolean Masking:
       NumPy supports advanced indexing techniques, such as fancy indexing and boolean masking, to select specific elements or subsets of arrays based on conditions.
  7.4 Structured Arrays:
        NumPy allows you to create structured arrays where each element can have multiple fields with different data types. This is useful when dealing with structured data or tabular data.
  7.5 Universal Functions:
       NumPy provides universal functions (ufuncs) that operate element-wise on arrays, such as add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide(). These functions are optimized for performance.

8. Performance Tips and Best Practices:
  8.1 Vectorization:
        NumPy's strength lies in vectorized operations, where functions are applied to entire arrays instead of looping over individual elements. This results in faster execution and cleaner code.
  8.2 Memory Efficiency:
        NumPy arrays are memory-efficient compared to Python lists, especially for large datasets. However, be cautious of creating unnecessary copies of arrays, as it can consume additional memory.
  8.3 Use NumPy Functions Instead of Loops:
        NumPy provides a wide range of functions for common operations, such as sum, mean, min, max, and more. Using these functions instead of explicit loops can significantly improve performance.
